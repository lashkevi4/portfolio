      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>Company
        Tickets online is one of the leading international providers of ticketing services and live entertainment.
        Before
        the
        outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, around 250 million tickets per annum were marketed using the company’s
        systems –
        be it through stationary box offices, online or from mobile terminals. Its online portals operate under brands
        such as
        eventim.de, oeticket.com, ticketcorner.ch, ticketone.it and entradas.com.
      </p>
      <p>LThe EVENTIM Group also includes many concert, tour and festival promoter companies for events like ‘Rock am
        Ring’, ‘Rock
        im Park’, ‘Hurricane’, ‘Southside’ and ‘Lucca Summer’. In addition, some of Europe’s most renowned venues are
        operated
        by CTS EVENTIM, for example the LANXESS Arena in Cologne, the K.B. Hallen in Copenhagen, the Waldbühne in Berlin
        and the
        EVENTIM Apollo in London.</p>
      <p>CTS Eventim AG & Co. KGaA (ISIN DE 0005470306) has been listed on the stock exchange since 2000 and is
        currently a
        member of the MDAX segment. In a situation dominated by extensive bans and restrictions on events as a result of
        the
        coronavirus pandemic, the Group generated revenue totalling 256.8 million Euro in 21 countries in 2020, after
        more than
        1.4 billion Euro the year before</p>

      <h3>Powerful software solutions</h3>
      <p>As a direct response to the hazards posed by the coronavirus, we have developed powerful software solutions to
        protect
        the health of people attending events. Algorithms control the allocation of seats and automatically ensure
        compliance
        with minimum distancing. Our newly-developed EVENTIM.CheckIn technology allows visitors to events to have
        their personal data conveniently recorded from their mobile phone, either in advance or directly on admission to
        the
        respective event.
      </p>
      <p>Since the end of 2020, we have been supporting the health authorities in Germany and Austria with a software
        solution
        for allocating and organising vaccination appointments. The system, which is based on our proven ticketing
        software,
        is designed for high levels of peak demand. Several tens of thousands of appointments can be provided within
        just a
        few minutes. Highest priority is assigned to protecting against tampering and cyberattacks, and to ensuring
        privacy.</p>

      <h3>partnership agreements</h3>
      <p>In Ticketing we concluded new partnership agreements for top-level sports events such as the European Handball
        Championships in 2022 and 2024, and for next year’s European Basketball Championships. EVENTIMSports, the
        specialist for
        the sports market, has signed long-term partnership agreements for ticketing and other services with Werder
        Bremen and Hannover 96, two long-standing football clubs.
      </p>
      <p>The DreamHaus agency
        headed by Matt Schwarz joined our family of promoters at the beginning of 2021, bringing the network to a total
        of 36
        promoters in 15 countries.</p>
